# KnotFigures

Basic Mathematica notebooks for producing publication-quality illustrations of knots and braids. The notebooks show compact patterns, derivations, and figure-generation workflows; PDFs are included for quick preview

## ✨ What’s inside

- `Braid stuff.nb` — notebook exploring braid representations and figure creation  
- `Derivations .nb` — derivations and helper cells used for figure construction  
- `Figures-EncryptingPrimeNumbers.nb` — Example of figures used [this preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04350))
- Exported previews: `Braid stuff.pdf`, `Derivations_notebook.pdf`, `Figures-EncryptingPrimeNumbers.pdf`  
- `LICENSE` — GPL-3.0 license  
- `README.md` — this file
